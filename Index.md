Manifesto 2020. 

Everyone should have a personal search engine that is run locally but operates globally. 

Everyone should bear the responsibility of preserving all information of personal interest. 

Everyone should have means of controlling channels of incoming and outgoing data. 

Anyone should be able to comment any piece of data - large or small. 

There should be a unified data structure format.

---------------------------
I beleave time is come for such a mindset in regard of global information distribution. 

Publishing texts on servers one doesn't own is a waist of mental effort in long term. One has to conform to regulations of the owners. One is subject to being placed into a restricted box of information sources. This leads to degrading of ideas, poor diversity and slow overall progress. 

You may find other reasons as well. There is nothing in the way to achieving this in near future. A little piece of software that combines existing libraries :)

As to unified data format a natural choice would be using the part that is common to all natural languages. 

1. They all give us the ability to give a name to something that is wittnessed by both the person that speaks and the person that listens.

2. They allow us to add properties to things that the speaker and audience have they current attention at.

3. They provide a way of back-referencing notions that has come up previously in a discussion. This may happen for different reasons: a) to group several of them into one unit, b) to give a new name, c) to add or remove some properties because their presence or absence is relevant at a given moment of a discussion.

4. They all have negation.

Such a format is not suited to storing in big tables. A combination of table based and graph based storage engines may play well together.
